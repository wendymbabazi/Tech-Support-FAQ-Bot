**Tech-Support-FAQ-Bot**

* Skill: IT Support & Technical Documentation

*  Why: Technical support is often about answering the same questions over and over. I built this to automate that process, providing a 24/7 "self-solve" tool for users. This mirrors the logic I used to build the first knowledge base at BPOSeats, where the goal was to let clients solve issues without waiting for an agent.

How it works:

Interface: A clean, responsive UI for quick user interaction.

Logic: It matches user queries against a set of predefined technical solutions.

Scalability: The structure allows for a JSON-based knowledge base to be plugged in, making it easy to update as new software issues arise.

The Impact: It focuses on reducing ticket volume and improving the user experience by providing instant answers to common hurdles.
